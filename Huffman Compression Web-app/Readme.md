Huffman Compression Web App
Overview
This project is a web-based file compression and decompression tool leveraging Huffman Coding, an efficient algorithm for lossless data compression. The system integrates a Flask backend and an interactive UI built with modern web technologies, including Three.js and GSAP, for a visually engaging experience.
Features
•	File Compression: Encodes input files into a compressed format using Huffman coding.
•	File Decompression: Restores compressed files back to their original form.
•	Performance Metrics: Displays compression ratio and percentage reduction for evaluation.
•	Futuristic UI: Built with Three.js and GSAP for a stunning 3D effect.
•	Seamless Integration: Frontend and backend work smoothly for a great user experience.
Tech Stack
Backend
•	Flask – Python web framework for handling file uploads & processing.
•	Huffman Algorithm – Implemented in C++ for high-speed compression.
Frontend
•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Core web technologies.
•	Three.js – For 3D animated backgrounds.
•	GSAP – Smooth animations.
•	Fetch API – Communicates with Flask backend.
